People appearing in the photographs of the training, validation or test sets are uniquely present in one set. For example, if one person is in the training set, then that person is not present in either the validation or test set. 

We made our test, train and validation splits as unbiased as we could. Other splits can be constituted but be aware that image splits can influence performance more than algorithmic implementations. Assigning the photographed person to a unique split is a good way to work with less-biased data. 

In a few pictures of the drinking and sitting dataset, the subject is an animal, not a human.
