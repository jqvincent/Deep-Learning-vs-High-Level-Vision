Human performance on our image datasets was assessed via [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) using the [psiTurk](https://psiturk.org/) environment.

Each participant was presented with a batch of .gif files. Each .gif file consisted in a fixation cross during 500 ms, an image during 50, 150, 400 or 800 ms, and a forced choice yes/no question until the participant answered. The image duration changed randomly from one presentation to the next.

The "drinking" experiment is the most up-to-date: it shows a progress bar along the experiment, which is preferred by participants.
